# Arithmetic Operators
Used to perform basic mathematical operations. 
Operator 	Name	Description	Example
+	Addition	Adds two operands	x + y
-	Subtraction	Subtracts the right operand from the left	x - y
*	Multiplication	Multiplies two operands	x * y
/	Division	Divides left operand by the right, returns a float	x / y
%	Modulus	Returns the remainder of the division	x % y
**	Exponentiation	Raises the left operand to the power of the right	x ** y
//	Floor division	Divides and returns the largest integer less than or equal to the result	x // y

# Assignment Operators
Used to assign values to variables. 
Operator 	Example	Same As
=	x = 5	x = 5
+=	x += 3	x = x + 3
-=	x -= 3	x = x - 3
*=	x *= 3	x = x * 3
/=	x /= 3	x = x / 3
%=	x %= 3	x = x % 3
//=	x //= 3	x = x // 3
**=	x **= 3	x = x ** 3
# Comparison Operators
Used to compare two values and return a boolean result (True or False). 
Operator 	Name	Example
==	Equal	x == y
!=	Not equal	x != y
>	Greater than	x > y
<	Less than	x < y
>=	Greater than or equal to	x >= y
<=	Less than or equal to	x <= y

# Logical Operators
Used to combine conditional statements. 
and: Returns True if both statements are true.
or: Returns True if one of the statements is true.
not: Reverses the result; returns False if the result is true. 

# Identity Operators
Used to compare if two variables point to the same object in memory. 
is: Returns True if both variables are the same object.
is not: Returns True if both variables are not the same object. 

# Membership Operators
Used to test if a sequence is presented in an object. 
in: Returns True if the value is found in the sequence.
not in: Returns True if the value is not found in the sequence.

# Operator Precedence
-   When an expression contains multiple operators, Python follows a specific order of precedence to determine which operation is performed first, similar to mathematical order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS).
